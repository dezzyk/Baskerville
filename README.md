# Baskerville | GPU Powered Minimalist Word Processor.

Minimalistic word processor with an emphasis on limiting editing while writing. Only a small amount of lines are visible at a time while writing to prevent the user from giving into the urge to look back and edit and instead focus on progress.

All code is WIP.
